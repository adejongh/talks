Some lessons learnt, and why bananas may not help.

# Disclaimer

## Please Note

All names, examples, figures and PITAs presented and discussed during this talk
are anecdotal. Any resemblance of or similarity to real people, systems or
companies would be accidental.

Sorry to disappoint.

???
Before we start, audience must understand that even though our experience is
based on real life projects / situations, all examples presented are
fictituous.

---

# Scope

- Scaling / Scalability?

???
Scaling can mean many things / involve many disciplines: Team structure /
growth, organisational setup, which hardware to choose

--
- Keeping a transactional system with massive growth afloat operationally

???
We'll cover just a small fraction of all this (actually based on our
experience), coming into a situation that has some pressure and unhappiness
already.

--
- Technical aspects of scaling

???
And as we are software engineers / architects, we'll cover technical aspects,
mainly. But, as may become clear, the greatest technology might be useless if
applied in the wrong place... thus it's never about technology only.

# Metrics

## Why Metrics?

--

What Matters Actually?

--

Happiness? Happy customers? Happy stakeholders?

???
Complex systems (like transaction processing systems) are complex... and have
many stakeholders. If the system breaks under load, everybody will be unhappy
(except for maybe competitors).

--

Don't make me wait!

???
Many things influence happiness of our stakeholders, but from an operational /
scaling / growth perspective, having to wait (or timeout with an error) is
BAAAAD.

---

## Is anybody waiting?

--

How do we know?

--

Metrics?

???
Interaction: What metrics? Who in the audience has metrics? (Probably the majority won't have any / won't know)
Yes, there are always metrics of sorts...

--

Logs?

???
Let's check log files

---

## This is how we roll (Demo)

???
This slide is about the log rolling demo
Show logs of a fictitious server, including response times: Some may look okay,
others not, maybe we see some errors (stack traces) as well. All in all, it
seems the logs contain the information we need.

Now show logs of a server with much higher requests per second. Imagine 20 MB
of logs per second. And it's a clustered environment, so 20MB per second times
number of hosts...

Tools that aggregate data from log files might help, there are even open source
one's that do that, e.g. "logstash" and http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/ ... good idea to use!

But... does it help with metrics? Let's see... we can most likely get the
*average response time* via such a tool.

(the fictituous server can maybe show the average response time on a uri?)

...

---

## The Forest for the Trees

We need meaningful metrics

--

- Average response time?

???
If the average response time is *good enough*, then everybody should be happy.

But the average becomes meaningless over time: If something started going wrong
(and users started screaming) 2 minutes ago, the average response time won't
indicate anything bad, until poor performance affects the average (of maybe a
very long time).

--

Example: Since the last restart of the server 97267 seconds ago, we received
1166409 requests, and in the average a request took 863ms.

???
Conclusion: we need recency! What was the response time *in the last
minute(s)*?

--

We need *recency*.

???
But there is another issue, consider this example:

--

*Average* response time is 185ms. Sounds acceptable!

--

... Out of 1000 requests, 980 of them took 25ms, and 20 took 8000ms.

???
Those 20 requests are an issue! And just with an average, we won't see that.
Solution: percentiles

--

We need *percentiles*.

---

## Recency and Percentiles

- reservoir sampling
- forward decaying priority sampling

... to be continued

Example of Glassfish monitoring levels all set to LOW, and poor performance

Transaction monitoring is synchronizing on one counter to count transactions

---

## Glassfish monitoring

Everyone is waiting

```java
"p: thread-pool-1; w: 179" daemon prio=3 tid=0x00000000014c7000 nid=0x58b1 
waiting for monitor entry [0xfffffd7dff2f0000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)
        at java.util.Vector.addElement(Vector.java:572)
        - waiting to lock <0xfffffd7e20b52080> (a java.util.Vector)
        at com.sun.enterprise.distributedtx.J2EETransactionManagerImpl
             .begin(J2EETransactionManagerImpl.java:959)
        ...
```
---

## Glassfish monitoring

For one vector

```java
"p: thread-pool-1; w: 174" daemon prio=3 tid=0x000000000ae81800 nid=0x58ab 
runnable [0xfffffd7dff9f8000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE
        at java.util.Vector.indexOf(Vector.java:361)
        - locked <0xfffffd7e20b52080> (a java.util.Vector)
        at java.util.Vector.indexOf(Vector.java:335)
        at java.util.Vector.removeElement(Vector.java:594)
        - locked <0xfffffd7e20b52080> (a java.util.Vector)
        at java.util.Vector.remove(Vector.java:745)
        at com.sun.enterprise.distributedtx.J2EETransactionManagerImpl
             .monitorTxCompleted(J2EETransactionManagerImpl.java:1384)
        ...
```

## Lessons

What exactly does LOW mean?

--

At high speeds wind resistance counts!

---

![id book](images/id.jpg)

???
E.g. JBPM integer ids

---

## Identity

Integer maximum value 2^31-1 = 2147483647

--

At 10 TPS:  59652 hours (6.8 years)

--

At 200 TPS:  2982 hours (124 days)

--

Whereas maximum value of a long is 9223372036854775807L

--

At 200 TPS that will last... 1462356043 years

(safely much longer than you will have to support it!)

---

## Lessons

They grow up so quickly

--

Don't blindly trust third-party libraries

---

![garbage](images/garbageduplo.jpg)

???
High memory churn

Examples of how long a GC takes with a large heap
---

## Garbage collection

Heap too small

--

Large heap

--

Swap to disk

--

Collector algorithm

---

## Lessons in garbage

Understand your application's eating patterns

--

Experiment with collectors and GC settings

--

Analyze!

---

![chicken](images/chicken-virtualization.jpg)

---

## Virtualization

23:02:50 up 8 days, 11:01,  6 users,  load average: 1.01, 1.00, 0.81

--

What does those numbers mean when the CPU is virtual?

--

And, if the CPU allocation is dynamically scaled?

---

## Virtualization lessons

Really really understand your virtualization technology

--

Do not use dynamically scaled resources (unless you're very clever)

--

Unless of course, you have unlimited hardware ;-)

---

## Glassfish transaction journal

---

## Nagios monitoring

???
File handles running out on a local virtual machine attach

---

![queue](images/queue.jpg)


???
Looking at messages that are in flight - still on queue while not committed

Examples of where messages are pre-delivered

---

## Message queues

---

## Cheap tools

--

Thread dumps - the poor man's production profiler

--

Print the garbage collection stats

--

Be proactive - look at the system when it is busy

--

Replaying?

--

Centralized view of everything (logs, errors, metrics)
