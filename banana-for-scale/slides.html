# Disclaimer

## Please Note

All names, examples, figures and PITAs presented and discussed during this talk
are anecdotal. Any resemblance of or similarity to real people, systems or
companies would be accidental.

Sorry to disappoint.

Before we start, audience must understand that even though our experience is
based on real life projects / situations, all examples presented are
fictituous.

---

# Scope

- Scaling / Scalability?

???
Scaling can mean many things / involve many disciplines: Team structure /
growth, organisational setup, which hardware to choose

--
- Keeping a transactional system with massive growth afloat operationally

???
We'll cover just a small fraction of all this (actually based on our
experience), coming into a situation that has some pressure and unhappiness
already.

--
- Technical aspects of scaling

???
And as we are software engineers / architects, we'll cover technical aspects,
mainly. But, as may become clear, the greatest technology might be useless if
applied in the wrong place... thus it's never about technology only.

# Metrics

---

## Why Metrics?

--

What Matters Actually?

--

Happiness? Happy customers? Happy stakeholders?

???
Complex systems (like transaction processing systems) are complex... and have
many stakeholders. If the system breaks under load, everybody will be unhappy
(except for maybe competitors).

--

Don't make me wait!

???
Many things influence happiness of our stakeholders, but from an operational /
scaling / growth perspective, having to wait (or timeout with an error) is
BAAAAD.

---

## Is anybody waiting?

--

How do we know?

--

Metrics?

???
Interaction: What metrics? Who in the audience has metrics? (Probably the majority won't have any / won't know)
Yes, there are always metrics of sorts...

--

Logs?

???
Let's check log files

---

## This is how we roll (Demo)

???
This slide is about the log rolling demo
Show logs of a fictitious server, including response times: Some may look okay,
others not, maybe we see some errors (stack traces) as well. All in all, it
seems the logs contain the information we need.

Now show logs of a server with much higher requests per second. Imagine 20 MB
of logs per second. And it's a clustered environment, so 20MB per second times
number of hosts...

Tools that aggregate data from log files might help, there are even open source
one's that do that, e.g. "logstash" and http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/ ... good idea to use!

But... does it help with metrics? Let's see... we can most likely get the
*average response time* via such a tool.

(the fictituous server can maybe show the average response time on a uri?)

...

---

## The Forest for the Trees

We need meaningful metrics

--

- Average response time?

???
If the average response time is *good enough*, then everybody should be happy.

But the average becomes meaningless over time: If something started going wrong
(and users started screaming) 2 minutes ago, the average response time won't
indicate anything bad, until poor performance affects the average (of maybe a
very long time).

--

Example: Since the last restart of the server 97267 seconds ago, we received
1166409 requests, and in the average a request took 863ms.

???
Conclusion: we need recency! What was the response time *in the last
minute(s)*?

--

We need *recency*.

???
But there is another issue, consider this example:

--

*Average* response time is 185ms. Sounds acceptable!

--

... Out of 1000 requests, 980 of them took 25ms, and 20 took 8000ms.

???
Those 20 requests are an issue! And just with an average, we won't see that.
Solution: percentiles

--

We need *percentiles*.

---

![percentiles](images/percentile-80.gif)

---

## Recency and Percentiles

- reservoir sampling
- forward decaying priority sampling

--

... we don't want to implement that ourselves

--

... rather use libraries smart people have created. Thanks, Coda Hale!

[Metrics Library](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) (For Java, many ports available)

--

Highly recommended: [Metrics, Metrics Everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czes-oa0yik)

???
Metrics, Metrics Everywhere: It's about linking code with business value (and
explaining important aspects of metrics in detail)

---

--

Record request rates and response times over time

--

... now you can compare

???
We'll see why this is so important later.

???

At some stage:  you're going to get the call that the monster is slow and or unstable

What can you do?

There are many things you can tweak in a big system.  I've listed some that came to mind.

---

## Paddle faster

* HTTP connection queue
--

* HTTP thread pools
--

* OS TCP/IP stack 
--

* Camel thread pools
--

* JDBC connection pools
--

* MDB pool size
--

* Bean caches
--

* Hibernate caches
--

* HTTP client pool size
--

* Message broker
--

* Database
--

* Heap sizes
--

* Garbage collection
--

* JVM flags

---

![monitoring wall](images/monitoring.jpg)

???
Let's go through some examples of things that went horribly wrong, and see if we can learn something from them...

We were trying to get everyone to correctly setup their monitoring software.

Some well-meaning soul thought setting the Glassfish transaction monitoring to LOW will help.  
And it does - mostly - how else can we get data for our metrics?

**What do you think happened?**

---

## Glassfish monitoring

Hmmm?

```java
"p: thread-pool-1; w: 179" daemon prio=3 tid=0x00000000014c7000 nid=0x58b1 
waiting for monitor entry [0xfffffd7dff2f0000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)
        at java.util.Vector.addElement(Vector.java:572)
*        - waiting to lock <0xfffffd7e20b52080> (a java.util.Vector)
        at com.sun.enterprise.distributedtx.J2EETransactionManagerImpl
             .begin(J2EETransactionManagerImpl.java:959)
        ...
```

???
Almost all threads that had anything to do with transactions were blocked

---

## Glassfish monitoring

For one vector

```java
"p: thread-pool-1; w: 174" daemon prio=3 tid=0x000000000ae81800 nid=0x58ab 
runnable [0xfffffd7dff9f8000]
   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE
        at java.util.Vector.indexOf(Vector.java:361)
*        - locked <0xfffffd7e20b52080> (a java.util.Vector)
        at java.util.Vector.indexOf(Vector.java:335)
        at java.util.Vector.removeElement(Vector.java:594)
*        - locked <0xfffffd7e20b52080> (a java.util.Vector)
        at java.util.Vector.remove(Vector.java:745)
        at com.sun.enterprise.distributedtx.J2EETransactionManagerImpl
             .monitorTxCompleted(J2EETransactionManagerImpl.java:1384)
        ...
```

???
Transaction monitoring was synchronizing on one counter to count transactions

---

## Lessons

What exactly does LOW mean?

--

Complexity comes at a price

--

At high speeds wind resistance counts!

---

![id book](images/id.jpg)

???
Someone with an identity crisis... 

Acute accent to be added on the "i"

Database constraint violations in the logs, and they were getting more and more frequent.

It was quite strange since the system was using Hibernate for persistence

Sequence based approach for the ids.

It is not possible for the ids to clash.

**Or is it?**

**Can you guess what happened here... **

Using integers for its id field.

Single sequence used across different tables.

"holes" in the range of ids in the different tables.  

And, fortunately, only one of the tables really persisted

---

## Identity theft

Integer maximum value 2^31-1 = 2147483647

???
Strictly speaking you have twice as long - if the integer wraps into negative.  And then the fun starts!

--

At 10 TPS:  59652 hours (6.8 years)

--

At 200 TPS:  2982 hours (124 days)

--

Whereas maximum value of a long is 9223372036854775807

--

At 200 TPS that will last... 1462356043 years

(safely much longer than you will have to support it!)

---

## Lessons

They grow up so quickly

--

Don't blindly trust third-party libraries

---

![garbage](images/garbageduplo.jpg)

???
This is a favourite of mine - good old garbage collection in Java

**How many people have tried tuning garbage collectors in anger?**

**How many of you actually made it better?**

GC is especially hard to tune correctly if you have app with high memory churn

---

## Garbage collection

Heap too small

???
Very frequent collections - stop-the-world type

--

Large heap

???
Deferring the obvious...  and now you have a huge stop-the-world pause

--

Swap to disk

???
Even worse - if you're oversubscribing memory in the system it may start swapping during GC

Then it becomes really really slow

--

Collector implementation and parameters

???
Change one thing at a time, and study the results

---

## Lessons in garbage collecting

Understand your application's eating patterns.  Maybe send it on a diet too.

--

Experiment with collectors and GC settings in a safe environment

--

Have verbose gc logs switched on (with some other switches) - and analyze it


---

![chicken](images/chicken-virtualization.jpg)

???
Hard to find a picture that illustrates virtualization

---

## Virtualization

23:02:50 up 8 days, 11:01,  6 users,  load average: 1.01, 1.00, 0.81

???
**What do those numbers mean?**

Know how many CPUs the system has

--

What does it mean when the CPU is virtual?

--

And, if the CPU allocation is dynamically scaled?

---

## Virtualization lessons

Really really understand your virtualization technology

--

Do not use dynamically scaled resources

--

Unless of course, you have unlimited hardware ;-)

---

![retro drive](images/retrodrive.jpg)

"...at least ten times better than floppies..."

???
The system mysteriously started slowing down more and more

All the normal culprits were investigated - could not really find the cause

Eventually some thread dumps were produced

---

## Glassfish transaction journal

```java
"p: thread-pool-1; w: 273" daemon prio=3 tid=0x000000000cc35000 nid=0x7e3c1 
waiting for monitor entry [0xfffffd7fdbd73000]
  java.lang.Thread.State: BLOCKED (on object monitor)
  at com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.LogFile.write(LogFile.java:157)
*  waiting to lock <0xfffffd7e810a6ff8> (a com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.LogFile)
  at com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.CoordinatorLog.formatLogRecords(CoordinatorLog.java:1082)
  locked <0xfffffd7e7b645ef8> (a com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.CoordinatorLog)
  at com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.CoordinatorLog.write(CoordinatorLog.java:535)
  at com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.TransactionState.setState(TransactionState.java:780)
  at com.sun.jts.CosTransactions.TopCoordinator.commit(TopCoordinator.java:2134)
```

???

**Anyone guess what went wrong here?**

Filesystem of transaction log shared with application's log files

And...  they were running through a lot of logs (remember Chris' demo?)

It was actually holding up the transaction logs to be committed to disk

---

## Lessons

Systems can share resources in surprising ways

--

DevOps is a reality

---

![file handles](images/filehandle.jpg)

???
This time the call was more serious

The system just stopped working

---

## Too many open files

```java
java.io.FileNotFoundException: .../imq/instances/imqbroker/etc/passwd (Too many open files)
  at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)
  at java.io.FileInputStream.<init>(FileInputStream.java:106)
  ...
```

???

Log fragment in the message broker log file

Listed all the open files to see which process was holding on to the handles

It was the Java virtual machine "local attach" mechanism - as in when using tools like jconsole and jvisualvm

We were embarrased to find that it was our JMX metrics collector running on the broker that triggered a bug in the JVM

---

## Lessons?

Soak test all parts of your application - even the monitoring bits

---

![queue](images/queue.jpg)


???

Message queues are really simple things, yes?

**What exactly does the queue length tell you?**

Both messages that still need to be consumed AND messages that have been picked up but not committed

Recently had this very strange problem where messages would look as if they are stuck on a queue, but not all the consumers would be busy

Had us flummoxed for a while - until we realized that you can set up a "consumer flow limit", or prefetch message count

This is the number of messages that will be predelivered to a consumer in a batch

In this case the few busy consumers had prefetched all the messages off the queue - and the other consumers were idle

However the first message in the prefetched list was poisonous, and the consumer dealt with it badly

It held up all the messages in the prefetched list - and they were stuck forever

A bit like standing in the queue at Pick 'n Pay and the person right at the front has an item without a price

---

## Lessons

You have to understand the most mundane things

---

## Cheap tools

--

Thread dumps - the poor man's production profiler

--

Print the garbage collection stats

--

Be proactive - look at the system when it is busy

--

Replaying?

--

Centralized view of everything (logs, errors, metrics)

# Change One Thing at a Time

---

Simple rule

???
As last item on the agenda, something more relaxing.

--

... we broke it.

???
It sounds so simple... why is it worth mentioning?
Let's look at an (again purely fictituous) example.

---

> "The bean pool is at its limit under load, let's double it. It will certainly
reduce response times in the average."

--

> "We can certainly reduce garbage collection waits by adding 50% more GC
threads. As there's enough CPU, there is no risk here!"

--

We make the changes together (no time to lose!) Just one maintenance window a
day!)...

--

and response times degrade even more. :(

--

All we can do is an emergency rollback.

--

And we are as smart (or dumb) as before.

???
The tragic is: We want to make progress, be helpful, and we are pretty damn
sure that the two changes are low risk and unrelated.

Also: Often we cannot make changes any time in production, we have to wait for
a maintenance window, adhere to a strict process, thus "batching up" production
changes seems useful!

---

Cause and Effect...

--

are often not what we expect.

--

Assumptions is the mother of all ____ups.
