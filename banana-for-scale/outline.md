Outline for the talk
====================

Late night ramblings...  Feel free to tear apart

Know your metrics
-----------------
Dive a bit into the metrics that people like to use - and then show why they do not work well (e.g. average)
Look at the different kinds of metrics given by codahale
Explain why 95th is good


Know your system
----------------
Understand symptoms and what they point to - is it an app problem, or a resource issue (does it even differ?)
How often is it really the hardware that is not "big" enough

A third, very important, point
------------------------------
Yes, that one
